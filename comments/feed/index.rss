					<description><![CDATA[The battery used was a 6Ah LFP from Shorai Batteries and has a peak discharge of 220 Amps. Now that sounds good but the starter motor is not powerful enough to crank up the vehicle. So a battery with a higher CCA rating would do no good in this case.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One suggestion to all teams would be when your engine is not firing up due to some electrical or mechanical issue don&#039;t keep on cranking the engine for long time.Find out the problem,rectify it and then crank.
1)When using a stock ECU a Ktm Engine should start within 2-3cranks,if not there&#039;s definitely a problem.More we crank without the engine getting fired up,there is improper lubrication to the cams and other parts which lead to excessive wear than designed.
2)When using a standalone ECU number of iterations are done during initial starting and tuning phase.Even there can be a chance of failure of decomp lever.So make sure you change your decomp lever even if there is slight change in the cranking sound.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Disassembling the head ain&#039;t a good option since you can face issues with the cylinder head sealing and also with the tightening torque of the cylinder head bolts. The other methods are, you hear a peculiar sound that the engine creates while cranking it seems as if the battery has discharged. The piston just constraints as the the starter motor simply draws current. Also you can frequently check for the battery voltage as a damaged decomp drains out the battery faster.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s great sharing such information. A good read. 
So disassembling the whole cylinder head is the only method to routine check the lever? Also, are there any symptoms observable or audible before reaching this stage of lever failure?]]></description>
